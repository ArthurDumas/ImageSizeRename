# ImageSizeRename
Simple little tool to rename image files so filename ends with dimensions like "-200x100".

Useful when exporting out of Adobe Illustrator using height or width mode.
Recursively process folderpath specified by rootFolder looking for image files.
Should probably make this a command line parameter but all my exports go to the same root folder so it works for me.
